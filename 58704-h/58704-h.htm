<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Notes from Southern California.</span></h2>
<p>We have been having a bountiful
share of rain in this neighborhood of
late; and while we have been having
warm drenching rains in the low
lands, there has been a steady fall of
snow in the mountains. As a result
of the latter fact large numbers
of Cedarbirds, Robins, Catbirds, etc.,
have left their usual haunts (the mountains),
and taken refuge in our warm
orange groves and vineyards. And
now a person cannot walk a mile
through the suburbs of the town, without
noticing several large flocks of
these birds feeding contentedly by the
roadside, or industriously probing
among decayed limbs, or under dead
leaves for bugs and larv&aelig;, upon which
they delight to feed. These birds however
do not breed in this locality, but as
soon as the warm weather sets in, they
betake themselves to the remote valleys
and fastnesses, situated among
the almost inaccessible ranges of the
Sierra Madre. Here all are protected
from the ravages of that &ldquo;fell egg-destroyer,&rdquo;
the school-boy. They
breed and rear their young in peace,
and we see no more of them until the
next &ldquo;cold spell&rdquo; sets in and causes
them to again visit us, or properly
speaking, &ldquo;our warm climate,&rdquo; until
the clemency of the weather will again
permit them to return to their accustomed
haunts. Further north however
these birds can be found among
the woods and forests the whole year
&rsquo;round.</p>
<p>At this season of the year we are
not alone favored with visits of the
land birds, but the aquatic element is
very abundantly and variously represented
among our ponds and streams;
in fact, out of a bag of twenty or thirty
ducks, which a hunter may be so fortunate
as to secure as a reward for a
day&rsquo;s sport, he can generally single
out from twelve to fifteen different
species, from the majestic old Mallard
or &ldquo;Greenhead,&rdquo; to the diminutive
Butterball or &ldquo;Silkduck.&rdquo; Quite a
number of these ducks remain with
us during the breeding season; in fact
I have personally obtained &ldquo;sets&rdquo; of
eggs of the Cinnamon Teal, Baldpate,
Mallard, Ruddy Duck, Godwall, Redhead,
Pintail and Greenwinged Teal;
besides I have heard several authentic
accounts of &ldquo;sets&rdquo; of some other species
of ducks being secured by other
Oologists in different portions of this
county. The principal or most profitable
grounds on which to successfully
search for nests of various species
of ducks and other waterfowl is
amongst the immense &ldquo;tule lands&rdquo; and
sloughs of a marsh called &ldquo;Gospel
Swamp.&rdquo; This is a place about sixty
miles from Los Angeles, and occupying
many square miles of country, including
the bogs, willow swamps, tidelands,
etc. It is a veritable paradise
for ducks of all species; and during
the sporting season I have spent some
very pleasant and well repaid time, by
trudging around its extremities, armed
with a good ten-bore &ldquo;breech-loader,&rdquo;
with an evil intent upon the unsuspecting
ducks and geese. Not withstanding
the thousands and thousands
of birds annually slaughtered in these
swamps by the professional &ldquo;pot&rdquo; or
market hunters, as well as the havoc
wrought by amateur sportsmen, still
the number of the birds never decrease
to a perceptible extent; but, like
the &ldquo;Hydra,&rdquo; where you kill one to-day,
you will find two to-morrow.
Along towards spring the birds begin
to assemble together in vast flocks of
countless thousands, and depart for
unknown latitudes in the &ldquo;far north.&rdquo;
Their time of departure seems to be
invariably during the night; in fact
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
I have often noticed large numbers of
ducks assembling at the same given
lake or pond. This congregating
would perhaps occupy a lapse of several
days, the numbers apparently augmented
by large additions each succeeding
night. At length, after a vast
number has congregated, you will
notice a great deal of excitement
among the large flocks; a seeming dissatisfaction
and restlessness, evinced
by loud calls and continual fluttering,
splashing, etc. After all these signs
of busy life, if you visit the lake the
next morning you will probably find
it lonely and deserted, without a vestige
of yesterday&rsquo;s tumult and life,
save a few lonely, sick looking Teals,
who were too weak or tired perhaps to
join the flight of their fellows the preceding
night. But they may wait for
the next flight which at once begins
to form, with new additions each succeeding
night, and in a few days we
have an exact repetition of the assemblage
and flight of a few days previous.
The assembling of these birds
is usually at some large lake convenient
for their purpose, and the additions
in the shape of small straggling
flocks, are very probably detachments
of ducks which have left the small
ponds and streams, where they have
passed the winter in detached flocks,
and as if by some previously concerted
plan assemble here so as to take their
departure <i>en masse</i> for the possible
view of both company and protection.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Egg Collecting in Colorado.</span></h2>
<p>On a pleasant morning in the early
part of May last, (May 2, 1885) our
collector put his gun, collecting-box,
etc., into the buckboard, and started
for a point 16 miles below Greeley, on
the Platte. The destination was a
long island midway in the Platte while
on either side was the rushing, dirty
river. This island was noted among
the boys of the neighborhood as a
great resort for crows, owls, herons
and other large birds during the breeding
season; but, owing to the river being
high in the spring of the year few
have ever cared to reach the island for
such &ldquo;trifles as bird&rsquo;s-eggs.&rdquo; &rsquo;Twas
too early for herons&rsquo; eggs, too late for
owl&rsquo;s, but just the time for crows.
The latter we were after, and crows&rsquo;
eggs we determined to have. The
sight of a few nests in the trees on the
island, and several crows flapping
about, worked our desires to the highest
pitch. Stripping and holding all
necessary articles to take crow&rsquo;s eggs
with in one hand, we partly waded and
swam across the wild and dirty stream
to the crow-den shores. In a short
space of time I took 11 sets of 6 eggs,
and 3 of 5 each from nests from 12 to
20 feet from the ground, all eggs were
perfectly fresh. Once I thought I
had a set of Raven&rsquo;s eggs (280), as
they were larger than the average
crow&rsquo;s, and my aid shot a female raven
as she left the nest. It must have
been a mistake however on <i>her</i> part
and I have since given up the idea.</p>
<p>I flushed an American Long-Eared
owl (395) off of an old crow&rsquo;s nest
about 8 feet from the ground, and obtained
a handsome set of 6 eggs. It
was so late in the season for owl&rsquo;s
eggs that I was afraid they would
hatch out before I could get them to
the ground. On blowing them I was
much surprised to find them all perfectly
fresh. Has any one ever taken
a fresh set of 395 as late as this?</p>
<p>Also took one set of B. B. magpies
(286) 5 eggs, incubation well advanced;
nest 6 feet from the ground. We saw
several herons busily fixing up their
old nests in the high tops of a large
cottonwood, but we never get fresh
heron&rsquo;s eggs until the last of May.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Nesting of Brown-headed Nuthatch.</span></h2>
<p class="center small">(SITTA PUSSILLA)</p>
<p>All the accounts I have seen in
books say the brown-headed nuthatch
builds no nest, but lays her eggs in
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the bottom of a hollow in the tree on
the decayed wood. Now, I have never
found one that did not make an attempt
to build a nest. I have found
several, ranging from two to forty feet
from the ground, and in every case a
nest was built, composed of fibrous
roots, pieces of hanging moss, hair and
feathers mixed together. The nests
were built in a hollow in a decayed
tree, from one foot to three feet deep.
The nest is very loosely put together,
and it is impossible to remove it without
cutting the cavity open to the bottom
of the nest. A gentleman in
California, who is well versed in Ornithology
and Oology, who I wrote to
in regard to it, says his knowledge and
experience has been in almost every
case, that a nest is attempted by this
bird&mdash;the description of a nest taken
by him in Orange county, Fla., some
years ago is&mdash;the nest was composed
of pieces of fibrous, decayed wood,
small scales of pine bark, wings of
pine seeds, and a little woolly vegetable
material arranged in cup form.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">A Bird&rsquo;s Sagacity.</span></h2>
<p><span class="small">For the Sunny South Oologist:</span></p>
<p>The following little narrative occurred
at my old home in Kentucky,
some years ago: I had placed over
the roof of my house a bird box, and
for several years the martins had occupied
it, and I think the same pair
came back every year, for the male
appeared larger and had a coarser
voice (?) than any others I had ever
heard.</p>
<p>This spring of which I speak, the
blue birds had taken possession of the
box, and one morning while out for a
little fresh air I heard the welcomed
voice of the martin in the distance.
I turned to see from where the voice
came, and saw the old friend coming
alone. He came directly to the bird
box, and appeared very much surprised
to find it occupied, so at once
began an attack upon the inmates, but
the little birds were too much for the
old martin, and he had to give up to
them. (But this was only for a short
time.) So he flew to a neighboring
roof, and sat there for a time as if
meditating what to do, and then flew
in a direct line toward the south from
whence he had come. The little blue
birds seemed to congratulate themselves
upon their victory, but they
were too soon, for the next morning
at about the same time, I heard the
voice which seemed to say &ldquo;pitch in,
pitch in,&rdquo; and I knew he was coming.
Upon looking I saw him in the lead
with about a dozen other martins following.
I waited to see his purpose,
and was not long in finding it out, for
he flew direct to the bird box, and
perching himself on the top gave the
orders, &ldquo;Pitch in! pitch in!&rdquo; and they
did pitch in from both sides.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It is needless to say how it terminated,
for the old martin and his mate
raised a brood that year, and came
year after year until I came west.</p>

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>A Georgia paper says that before
the war there was a bird in the south
that fed exclusively on cockle-burrs.
At a certain season of the year these
birds would sweep down on the fields
and when they departed not a burr
remained. The smell of burnt and
burning powder for four years seems
to have been too much for the burr-eaters.
Since then not a bird of the
kind is to be found in the south; but
the burrs are here yet.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">The Scissor-tailed Flycatcher.</span></h2>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">milvulus forficatus (Gm.) swains.</span>)</p>
<p>This beautiful bird is one of the
commonest summer residents of North
Texas. They usually arrive from the
south about the 15th of April in small
flocks or pairs, and always make themselves
known by their loud and noise-some
voices. This bird has a very
peculiar way when flying, of stopping&mdash;as
it appears&mdash;in the air, and then
making a straight shoot upward to the
height of fifteen or twenty feet, and
instantly darting downward to about
a level with where it started. This is
always repeated two or three times
before taking their onward flight.
While making this tumble as it were,
it always gives loud, quick screams,
and is very conspicuous by the display
it makes in opening and closing
the tail like scissor blades. It is a
very active, dashing and noisy bird;
also very showy and graceful. The
general color is a hoary-ash, almost
white below, with a scarlet crown
patch, and a bright scarlet on the sides
at insertion of wings. The wings have
a blackish cast with whitish underparts,
and various parts of the body
are tinged with a rich salmon. Most
of the tail feathers are black or dusky,
while some of the longer ones are
mostly white or rosy; these feathers
are long and narrow, sometimes reaching
a foot in length. The above description
is that of a male now lying
before me. The female averages
smaller, and the tail is much shorter,
while the color of the plumage is duller
than that of the male.</p>
<p>They begin to nest about the 10th
of May, and fresh eggs may be found
as late as June 25th. The nest and
eggs resemble those of the kingbird
very much, and it is almost impossible
to distinguish them from each
other, unless they are well identified;
but, as a general thing, the scissor-tails&rsquo;
eggs have larger and more conspicuous
blotches than those of the
kingbird. During the summer of &rsquo;85
I found nests of the kingbird and
scissor tail in the same tree, and the
nests and eggs were identically the
same; so to make sure of the identity,
I had to wait until both birds had occupied
their own nest.</p>
<p>Their favorite nesting places are in
the scrubby postoak and mesquite
bushes growing on our broad prairies.
The nests are usually placed in forks
at from six to thirty feet from the
ground, and constructed of various
materials, such as weed-tops, wool,
cotton, rootlets, paper, rags, etc., and
lined with fibrous roots, wool, cotton,
etc.</p>
<p>The number of eggs laid are usually
four or five in number, of a rounded-oval
shape, the color being white,
boldly blotched or marked with reddish-brown,
and obscure lavender
shell markings, chiefly at the larger
end. The size of the eggs averages
about .67 by .85.</p>

<p>On the 28th of March, 1885, I found
a nest of the Red-shouldered Hawk,
containing two eggs, which I took.
Returning seven days later, and seeing
the bird fly from the nest, I concluded
to take another look at it, and
was very much surprised to find two
more eggs, although the shells were
much lighter marked than those taken
previously, which went to prove they
were deposited by the same bird.</p>

<p>Last summer, while out collecting,
I found a three-storied nest of the
Summer Yellow bird. Each story
contained one egg of the Cow bird,
and two of the Warblers. I also
found a double nest of the Bronzed
Grackle containing nine eggs; four in
the lower part, and five in the upper.
The total number of eggs from both
nests were eighteen. Don&rsquo;t you think
this a pretty good haul from two
nests?</p>

<p>It is said that alligators&rsquo; eggs are
esteemed by the natives of the regions
where those reptiles abound. Mr.
Joseph, in his &ldquo;History of Trinidad,&rdquo;
says that he found the eggs of the
cayman very good. The female alligator
lays from 120 to 160 eggs.
They are about as large as the eggs
of a turkey, and have a rough shell
filled with a thick albumen.</p>

<p>There is an eagles nest on the stump
of an old tree in the middle of Caddo
lake, near Jefferson, Texas, and a pair

<p>One would, with a general knowledge
of the nesting habits of the Jays,
look for their nests in trees and bushes;
but with the recent observations
on the habits of this bird, by N. S.
Goss, in the Auk, April, 1885, we
have additional light thrown upon the
subject. He found quite a number of
nests of the Blue-fronted Jay in the
vicinity of Julian, California, in the
spring of 1884, and &ldquo;in all cases but
one, in holes and trough-like cavities
in trees and stubs, ranging from four
to fifty feet from the ground, generally
ten to twenty feet. The nest
found outside was built upon a large
horizontal limb of an oak close beside
a gnarl, the sprout-like limbs of which
thickly covered the nest overhead, and
almost hid it from view below.&rdquo; They
were quite bulky, loosely made of
sticks, stems of weeds, and lined with
fibrous rootlets and grasses; and, as
they were all built at or near the
opening, the tell-tale sticks projected
and made the finding of the nests
not difficult. Mr. Goss gives the
color of the eggs as light blue, speckled
and spotted with dark brown, rather
thickest at large end, and the measurements
of two sets, as follows: One
taken May 19, 1.20 by .87, 1.20 by .88,
1.21 by .88; May 21, 1.22 by .88, 1.15
by .86, 1.19 by .86, 1.16 by .85.</p>
<p>Mr. W. O. Emerson informs me that
he finds the nests in the vicinity of
Haywards, Cal., placed in oaks, redwood
and other tall trees.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">Nesting of the Long-eared Owl.</span></h2>
<p class="center small">(ASIO AMERICANUS)</p>
<p><span class="small">For the Sunny South Oologist:</span></p>
<p>It was on the bright spring morning
of April 25, 1885, that a friend and
myself started for the big woods in
search of hawks&rsquo;, crows&rsquo;, etc., eggs.</p>
<p>We first went to a crows&rsquo; nest we
found building the Saturday before,
and were most fortunate in securing
3 fresh eggs. This was comparatively
a good find, owing to the scarcity of
that bird in this locality.</p>
<p>We next made our way to a tammerac
swamp, and on the edge we
went a little out of our way to look
at an old crow&rsquo;s nest that we knew of,
for mere curiosity sake. In the center
of the nest two prongs poked out
and we thought they were two sticks
sticking up; but, to be sure, my friend
kicked on the tree, and to my great
joy the two prongs moved. At this
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
my friend began to climb the tree,
and when about half way up, a large
yellowish-brown bird flew sluggishly
off the nest, and I could see it was an
owl, but what kind I was uncertain.
When he reached the nest and shouted
down there were 5 eggs in it, I was
so excited that I went up and helped
him down with them, although there
was no need of it. They were of a
clear white, and almost globular in
form, and measured about 1.60 x 1.40
inches. We imagined them to be all
kinds of owls, and were very anxious
to find out what they were.</p>
<p>We hunted around now until noon
and then sat down by a spring and
ate our dinner, which we had brought
with us. After a little &ldquo;lounge&rdquo; in
the sun after our meal, we started out
again, and by 3 o&rsquo;clock p. m.,
had found nothing but last year&rsquo;s
nests. About 3:30 we came to another
tammerac swamp, and in the
center there was an old marsh hawk&rsquo;s
nest I was acquainted with, and we
made for it, thinking there might be
an owl&rsquo;s nest in it, and you may imagine
my delight at seeing the same
kind of horns sticking up in the center.
This nest was only about 7 feet
from the ground, and as soon as I
kicked the tree the owl flew off and
lit on a limb close by, and I identified
her as being a long-eared owl. I regretted
that I did not have my gun
with me, or I would have had her
this day all mounted. I climbed the
tree, and in the nest found four more
eggs just like those in the first nest,
and now our minds were lightened.</p>
<p>As it was getting time to be going
home, we started, and on arriving,
blew our eggs and found them to be
fresh; and one of the sets now glow
in the collection of the editor of this
paper.</p>
<p>I have found several sets besides
this, and know of others being found
around here, and they invariably occupy
other birds&rsquo; nests.</p>

<p class="center small">(GEOCOCCYX CALIFORNIANUS).</p>
<p><span class="small">For the Sunny South Oologist:</span></p>
<p>This species (which may be described
as a rather long tail with a
small bird on the &ldquo;for&rsquo;ard&rdquo; end of it)
occurs rarely in this locality. Ornithologists
generally give the number
of eggs in a set as &ldquo;6 to 9.&rdquo; I had
previously taken several sets, containing
from two to four eggs; and finding
a nest with two eggs on May 8th, 1885,
I concluded to give the bird a chance
to fill out the set. The nest was
placed in the bushy top of a small
black-jack oak, about twelve feet from
the ground. It was a bulky structure
16 inches in diameter, 5 inches in
depth, and nearly flat on the top&mdash;not
more than an inch deep, built of large
sticks, twigs, and weeds in the lining.
I visited the nest on the 9th and 10th,
and although the bird was &ldquo;tu hum&rdquo;
every time, the set had not increased
any in number. During the 11th,
12th and 13th, three more eggs were
added to the set, making five in all.
I waited until the 19th, when, as no
more eggs were laid, I took the nest,
shooting the female. On dissection I
found that within the next two or
three days two more eggs would have
been added to the set. Incubation
was about one-half advanced in two
of the eggs. The question is, can I
call this a full set? The female when
flushed from the nest would fly to the
ground, and all to be seen of her afterwards
was a streak. They are famous
runners, and it takes a fast &ldquo;pony&rdquo; to
overtake them.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
